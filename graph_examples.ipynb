    "In the evolving landscape of AI and information retrieval, knowledge graphs have emerged as a powerful way to represent complex, interconnected information. A knowledge graph is a knowledge base that uses a graph-structured data model or topology to represent and operate on data. Knowledge graphs are often used to store interlinked descriptions of entities – objects, events, situations or abstract concepts – while also encoding the free-form semantics or relationships underlying these entities. [Source: Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_graph)\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes knowledge graphs particularly powerful is their ability to mirror human cognition in data. They more explicitly map the relationships between objects, concepts, or ideas together through both their semantic and relational connections. This approach closely parallels how our brains naturally understand and internalize information – not as isolated facts, but as a web of interconnected concepts and relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./media/coffee_graph_ex.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at a concept like \"coffee,\" we don't just know it's a beverage; we automatically connect it to related concepts like beans, brewing methods, caffeine, morning routines, and social interactions. Knowledge graphs capture these natural associations in a structured way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional RAG systems, while effective at semantic similarity-based retrieval, often struggle to capture broader conceptual relationships across text chunks. Knowledge Graph RAG addresses this limitation by introducing a structured, hierarchical approach to information organization and retrieval. By representing data in a graph format, these systems can traverse relationships between concepts, enabling more sophisticated query understanding and response generation. This approach allows for targeted querying along specific relationship paths, handles complex multi-hop questions, and provides clearer reasoning through explicit connection paths. The result is a more nuanced and interpretable system that combines the structured reasoning of knowledge graphs with the natural language capabilities of large language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "While [knowledge graphs are not a new concept](https://blog.google/products/search/introducing-knowledge-graph-things-not/), their creation has traditionally been a resource-intensive process. Early knowledge graphs were built either through manual curation by domain experts or by converting existing structured data from relational databases. This limited both their scale and adaptability to new domains.\n",

    "\n",
    "*[What is a Knowledge Graph (KG)?](https://zilliz.com/learn/what-is-knowledge-graph)*\n",
    "\n",
    "The introduction of LLMs has transformed this landscape. LLMs' capabilities in NLP, reasoning, and relationship extraction now enable automated construction of knowledge graphs from unstructured text. These models can identify entities, infer relationships, and structure information in ways that previously required extensive manual labor. As a plus, this allows knowledge graphs to be dynamically updated and expanded as new information becomes available, making them more practical and scalable for real-world applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see this in action ourselves, and compare it to traditional vector similarity techniques, we'll take a look at Microsoft's Open Source [GraphRAG](https://microsoft.github.io/graphrag/) and how it works behind the scenes."

    "\n",
    "An Entity is a distinct object, person, place, event, or concept that has been extracted from a chunk of text through LLM analysis. Entities form the nodes of the knowledge graph.

    "A Relationship defines a connection between two entities in the knowledge graph. These connections are extracted directly from text units through LLM analysis, alongside entities. Each relationship includes a source entity, target entity, and descriptive information about their connection. When duplicate relationships are found between the same entities, they are merged by combining their descriptions to create a more complete understanding of the connection.\n",

    "A Community is a cluster of related entities and relationships identified through hierarchical community detection, generally using the [Leiden Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leiden_algorithm). Communities create a structured way to understand different levels of granularity within the knowledge graph, from broad overviews at the top level to detailed local clusters at lower levels. This hierarchical structure helps in organizing and navigating complex knowledge graphs."

    "The user's query is initially processed through [Hypothetical Document Embedding (HyDE)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.10496), which creates a hypothetical document similar to those found in the graph already, but using the user's topic query. This document is embedded and used for semantic retrieval of the top-k relevant community reports. From these matches, we generate an initial answer along with several follow-up questions as a lightweight version of global search. They refer to this as the primer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once this primer phase is complete, we execute local searches for each follow-up question generated. Each local search produces both intermediate answers and new follow-up questions, creating a refinement loop. This loop runs for two iterations (noted future research planned to develop reward functions for smarter termination). An important note that makes these local searches unique is that they are informed by both community-level knowledge and detailed entity/relationship data. This allows the DRIFT process to find relevant information even when the initial query diverges from the indexing persona, and it can adapt its approach based on emerging information during the search.\n",

    "**Traditional/Naive RAG:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits:\n",
    "- Simpler implementation and deployment\n",
    "- Works well for straightforward information retrieval tasks\n",
    "- Good at handling unstructured text data\n",
    "- Lower computational overhead\n",
    "\n",
    "Drawbacks:\n",
    "- Loses structural information when chunking documents\n",
    "- Can break up related content during text segmentation\n",
    "- Limited ability to capture relationships between different pieces of information\n",
    "- May struggle with complex reasoning tasks requiring connecting multiple facts\n",
    "- Potential for incomplete or fragmented answers due to chunking boundaries\n",
    "\n",
    "**GraphRAG:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits:\n",
    "- Preserves structural relationships and hierarchies in the knowledge\n",
    "- Better at capturing connections between related information\n",
    "- Can provide more complete and contextual answers\n",
    "- Improved retrieval accuracy by leveraging graph structure\n",
    "- Better supports complex reasoning across multiple facts\n",
    "- Can maintain document coherence better than chunk-based approaches\n",
    "- More interpretable due to explicit knowledge representation\n",
    "\n",
    "Drawbacks:\n",
    "- More complex to implement and maintain\n",
    "- Requires additional processing to construct and update knowledge graphs\n",
    "- Higher computational overhead for graph operations\n",
    "- May require domain expertise to define graph schema/structure\n",
    "- More challenging to scale to very large datasets\n",
    "- Additional storage requirements for graph structure\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Differentiators:**\n",
    "1. Knowledge Representation: Traditional RAG treats everything as flat text chunks, while GraphRAG maintains structured relationships in a graph format\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Context Preservation: GraphRAG better preserves context and relationships between different pieces of information compared to the chunking approach of traditional RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Reasoning Capability: GraphRAG enables better multi-hop reasoning and connection of related facts through graph traversal, while traditional RAG is more limited to direct retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Answer Quality: GraphRAG tends to produce more complete and coherent answers since it can access related information through graph connections rather than being limited by chunk boundaries\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice between traditional RAG and GraphRAG often depends on the specific use case, with GraphRAG being particularly valuable when maintaining relationships between information is important or when complex reasoning is required. An important note as well, GraphRAG approaches still rely on regular embedding and retrieval methods themselves. They compliment eahcother!"
